          <li><strong>1912</strong>- Born in London, England</li>
          <li><strong>1931-1934</strong> - Turing studies mathematics as an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge</li>
          <li><strong>1936</strong> - Publishes his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" where he proves that not all decision problems are solvable.</li>
          <li><strong>1936-1938</strong> - Studies for a Ph.D at Princeton University and publishes his dissertation “Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals”</li>
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - In September, Turing begins working part time the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), working on breaking German codes.</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> - Continues to make major advancements in cryptography for the British government including the Bombe, a machine which could break the German Enigma and a secure voice scrambler.</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Travels to the US to advise US cryptographers.</li>
          <li><strong>1945-1949</strong> - Continues his academic research and develops the Turing test, a method for determining whether or not a computer can be considered intelligent.</li>
          <li><strong>1951-1952</strong>- Studies mathematical biology and publishes “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis”, a paper on how patterns and shapes develop in biological organisms.</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> - The police discover Turing’s homosexual relationship with Arnold Murray, he is convicted of “gross indecency”, and chemically castrated as punishment.</li>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> - Turing is found dead in his bedroom of cyanide poisoning.</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - John Graham-Cumming starts a petition asking the British government to apologize for persecuting Turing.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologized for Turing’s treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>2011</strong>- William Jones starts a petition asking the British government to pardon Turing for his conviction.</li>
            <li><strong>2013-2014</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II pardons Turing.</li>
